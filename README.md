# Library Management System
Library Management System is a console based application in python which uses text files to store books and users information. The application has different features like authentication, authorization and registration. We have two type of users: 1) Admin, who performs actions such as add a book, remove a book and display a book and 2) Students/Personnel who can also login and perform actions like borrow a book, display a book, search a book, return book and pay a fine.

### Tasks

#### 1. UML Diagrams
A UML diagram is a diagram based on the Unified Modeling Language with the purpose of visually representing a system along with its main actors, roles, actions, artifacts or classes, in order to better understand, alter, maintain, or document information about the system.
